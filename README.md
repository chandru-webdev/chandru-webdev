I am a motivated Java Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend web development. I build responsive and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, and develop scalable backend applications using Core Java and Spring Boot.

I have hands-on experience in designing RESTful APIs, integrating databases such as MySQL and MongoDB, and implementing secure authentication and state management solutions. I focus on writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code while following industry best practices.

Through projects such as e-commerce applications, food ordering systems, and an AI-based Anti-Money Laundering Detection System, I have strengthened my problem-solving abilities and practical development skills.

I am currently seeking an opportunity as a Java Full Stack Developer where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue growing in a professional environment.
